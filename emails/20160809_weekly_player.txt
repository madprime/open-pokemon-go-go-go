Thank you for contributing to Open Pokemon GO GO GO!

Your survey responses indicated you're willing to contribute to a brief weekly
survey. Thank you! Here's the link to the survey:

If you no longer want to contribute weekly surveys, you can indicate that in
the survey linked above.

So far 24 folks have signed up to share with this project, enabling others to
explore activity data and the Pokemon GO phenomenon! We're planning to make
our first public data release next week.

Know anyone else that might want to contribute? Please feel free to share
the website with them: http://openpokemon.science/

Thanks again!
